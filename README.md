# K-means Clustering on Iris Dataset

This project is part of **The Sparks Foundation - GripJan'23** internship program. The task focuses on predicting the optimum number of clusters using **K-means Clustering** and visually representing it. The dataset used in this project is the well-known **Iris dataset**.

## Task Overview
- **Task:** Predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually using **Unsupervised Machine Learning**.
- **Method:** K-means Clustering
- **Dataset:** [Iris Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11Iq7YvbWZbt8VXjfm06brx66b10YiwK-/view)
- **Done By:** Zain Ali

In this task, we aim to predict the optimum number of clusters in the Iris dataset and visualize the results. The K-means algorithm is used to segment the dataset into distinct clusters based on the features in the dataset.

## Dataset
The **Iris dataset** is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, classified into three different species based on four features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

## Steps Involved
1. **Importing Libraries**: The necessary libraries are imported for data handling, machine learning, and visualization.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is loaded, and any necessary preprocessing steps (such as checking for missing values) are performed.
3. **K-means Clustering**: The K-means algorithm is applied to the dataset to predict the optimum number of clusters.
4. **Visualization**: Visualize the clusters and their centroids using a scatter plot.
5. **Determine Optimal Number of Clusters**: The "Elbow Method" is used to determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting the inertia (sum of squared distances) against the number of clusters.
